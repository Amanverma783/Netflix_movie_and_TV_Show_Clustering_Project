**AlmaBetter Capstone Project - Unsupervised: Netflix Movies And Tv Shows Clustering**

**This project is a part of the Almabetter Pro Program Curriculum(Full Stack Data Science)**

**Project Summary**

The objective of this project is to analyze and cluster a dataset related to Netflix. **The dataset consists of various attributes associated with Netflix shows and movies, such as title, genre, release year, duration, rating, and others. The aim is to explore patterns and similarities among the content available on the platform and group them into meaningful clusters.**

Next, exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques will be utilized to gain insights into the dataset. **Visualizations and statistical summaries will be used to understand the distribution of variables, identify any trends, and explore relationships between different features.**

Once the dataset has been thoroughly analyzed, clustering algorithms such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, or density-based spatial clustering will be employed. These algorithms will group similar Netflix shows and movies together based on their attributes. **The optimal number of clusters will be determined using techniques like the elbow method or silhouette analysis.**

After the clustering process, the results will be evaluated and interpreted. The clusters will be analyzed to understand the common characteristics and patterns within each group. **This analysis will provide valuable information for Netflix in terms of content categorization, recommendation systems, and content acquisition strategies.**

Finally, the findings and insights from the clustering analysis will be summarized and presented in a clear and concise manner. Visualizations, charts, and graphs will be used to effectively communicate the outcomes of the project. Recommendations may also be provided based on the identified clusters, suggesting potential improvements or strategies for Netflix to enhance user experience and content offerings.

**Problem Statement :**

This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of **2019**. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.
In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.
Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting findings.
